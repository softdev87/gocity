GoCity is a web tool to visualize Go source code. This project is inspired on Code City project created by [Richard Wettel](https://twitter.com/richardwettel) and [JS City](https://github.com/ASERG-UFMG/JSCity/wiki/JSCITY) created by [Marcus Viana](https://github.com/malilovick).

This tool makes part of a scientific research developed at Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) and was advised by [Marco TÃºlio](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~mtov/)

## Structures Information

 - Folders are districts
 - Files are buildings
 - Structs are represented as buildings on the top of their files.

## Structures Characteristics

 - The Number of Lines of Source Code (LOC) represents the build color (high values makes the building dark)
 - The Number of Variables (NOV) in a function correlates to the building's base size.
 - The Number of methods (NOM) correlates to the building height.
